# 🧠 BugBotAgent — A Living System of Compression, Prediction & Defense

BugBotAgent is a biologically inspired agent architecture built on a simple idea:

> **Consciousness is compression. Prediction is survival.  
> An agent becomes alive when its past collapses into a meaningful present.**

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

BugBotAgent treats each subsystem as an **organ**:

- **Symbolic Attention Tensor** — meaning-compression organ  
- **STDP Spiking Layer** — adaptive learning organ  
- **Cyber Fuzz Engine** — immune system organ  
- **Robotics Embodiment** — motor organ  
- **Agent Core** — nervous system  

The agent is not a model.  
It is a **living architecture**.

## 🔬 Technical Overview

- Symbolic attention compresses input into interpretable vectors  
- STDP spikes adapt based on temporal patterns  
- Cyber fuzz engine detects anomalies  
- Robotics module embodies symbolic state  
- Agent core orchestrates perception → adaptation → defense → embodiment  

---

## ✅ Intended Use

- Cybersecurity education  
- Robotics simulation  
- Research on symbolic attention  
- Recruiter-facing demos  
- Experimental agent architectures  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not a general-purpose LLM  
- Symbolic tensors are experimental  
- STDP module is simplified  
- Robotics module is simulated  

---

## 🌀 Vision

BugBotAgent is a step toward agents that:

- compress experience  
- predict the next moment  
- defend themselves  
- embody meaning  
- evolve over time  

A living system — not just a model.
