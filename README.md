# 🐞 BugBot-Agent  
### A Modular AI Organism with Cyber, Vision, Embedding, and Symbolic Organs

BugBot-Agent is a living, modular AI system designed to dramatize perception, adaptation, anomaly detection, and renewal.  
It is built as a cockpit of interactive panels — each one representing an “organ” in the agent’s body.

This project blends:
- **Cybersecurity fuzzing + defense loops**  
- **Neural spike raster visualization**  
- **Tensor heatmaps**  
- **3D embedding projection**  
- **Symbolic attention experiments**  
- **Robotics arena scaffolding**  
- **Model card dashboards**  
- **Token visualization**  

All organs are swappable, modular, and independently runnable.

## 🚀 Features

### **Cyber Arena**
A live cyber‑simulation panel where the agent:
- Generates fuzz patterns  
- Records them  
- Defends against its own anomalies  
- Visualizes internal state  

### **Heatmap Panel**
Renders tensors as heatmaps for:
- Attention maps  
- Activation patterns  
- Symbolic density fields  

### **Spike Raster Panel**
Plots multi‑neuron spike trains for:
- STDP experiments  
- Temporal coding  
- Multi‑layer spiking architectures  

### **Embedding Projector**
Projects embeddings using:
- PCA  
- t‑SNE  
- UMAP  
- 3D scatter visualizations  

### **Fuzz Generator**
Standalone fuzz pattern generator with timestamped logs.

### **Robotics Arena (Scaffold)**
A future panel for:
- Sensor fusion  
- Motor commands  
- Embodied simulation  

### **Token Visualizer**
Displays token‑level activations and transformations.

### **Model Card Dashboard**
A clean panel for model metadata, lineage, and interpretability.

## 🧠 Philosophy

BugBot-Agent is built on a simple idea:

> **An agent is a cycle — perception → anomaly → adaptation → renewal.**

Each cockpit panel is an organ in that cycle.

- Heatmaps = perception  
- Raster spikes = temporal encoding  
- Fuzz patterns = anomaly  
- Cyber Arena = adaptation  
- Embedding projector = reflection  
- Robotics = embodiment  
- Model card = memory  

This repo is both a technical system and a symbolic one.
